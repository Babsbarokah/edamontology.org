EDAM is a simple ontology of well established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioinformatics, including types of data and data identifiers, data formats, operations and topics. EDAM provides a set of terms with synonyms and definitions - organised into an intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.

EDAM is a community project and its development can be followed at [GitHub](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). Our core priority is to be responsive to end-users.  Please [read the docs](http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

##   <a id="Scope">Scope</a>

EDAM includes 4 main sub-ontologies or 'branches' of concepts:

*   _**Data**_ - “Information, represented in an information artefact (data record) that is 'understandable' by dedicated computational tools that can use the data as input or produce it as output.”
*   _**Format**_ - “A defined way or layout of representing and structuring data in a computer file, blob, string, message, or elsewhere.”
*   _**Operation**_ - “A function that processes a set of inputs and results in a set of outputs, or associates arguments (inputs) with values (outputs).”
*   _**Topic**_ - “A category denoting a rather broad domain or field of interest, of study, application, work, data, or technology. Topics have no clearly defined borders between each other.”

Noteworthy sub-branch:
*   _**Data->Identifier**_ - “A text token, number or something else which identifies an entity, but which may not be persistent (stable) or unique (the same identifier may identify multiple things).”

_**EDAM concepts. Boxes indicate top-level concepts (sub-ontologies) in EDAM.**_

As a general rule, the _**Data**_, _**Format**_, and _**Operation**_ branches include concepts strictly in domain of bioinformatics and computational biology: concepts purely concerning biology, computer science _etc._ are not included. The _**Topic**_ branch includes broader inter-disciplinary concepts from the biological and medical domains.



##   <a id="Architecture">Architecture</a>

EDAM has 3 components:

*   [Concepts](concepts.html) - All concepts have a name (the term or label) and definition. Further, a concept may have simple relations to other EDAM concepts, as well other intrinsic properties, _e.g._ an identifier may have a regular expression defining its syntax.
*   [Hierarchy](relations.html#is_a) - Every concept (excluding top-level concepts) is related to one or more other concepts within the same branch by an _**is a**_ relation (specialisation). Hence EDAM has 4 primary hierarchies (for _Data_, _Format_, _Operation_, and _Topic_).
*   [Relations](relations.html) - Concepts are related by defined relation types (see below), which reflect well established or self-evident principles, and are used primarily to define internal consistency of EDAM.

**EDAM architecture is very simple. Boxes indicate top-level concepts (sub-ontologies), and lines indicate types of relations.

We recommend, however, that while EDAM is being actively maintained by its authors, substantial derived work, major modifications (especially conceptual and semantic), and re-definitions of concepts and other content (_e.g._ additional constraints on EDAM concepts/`owl:Class`-es within `owl:imports` meant with universal validity, that would "close" some desired options of the open-world assumption) are consulted with the EDAM core developers beforehand at the time of consideration, and consistent solutions are sought in collaboration.
